(probably not using all of these, just dumping anything related to the theme)
(sources with a star ⭐ we are definetly using)
https://co2.earth/
^Could be used for info for an environmental snapshot of today and why green energy is necessary to implement here and now.
https://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/energy-act-2020 
^energy act of 2020 shows movements in industrial users in clean energy and water implementations and also the 
measuring of their cost efficiency compared to fossil fuel energy productions. not super relevant to the average
household owner but could be used to show that america is collectively putting in effort towards green energy
so individuals should to.
https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/residential-clean-energy-credit ⭐
^relevant info for the main tax incentive in the us, the residential clean energy program.
main points: the credit is dollar for dollar, meaning the amount of credit acquired can be
subtracted from total income tax (i.e. total tax is 10k, but credit gathered was 2k, so subtract it and now tax is just 8k)
credit gathered is 30% cost of implementing the green energy residentially, and it's reoccuring annually
(but it only lasts till 2033, where the credit program phases out. incentive for households to implement green energy now)
https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth ⭐
^my attention span is running thin rn so i didnt read it fully but a key point of the article is that renewable energy prices are
declining rapidly unlike anything seen before. like, from 2009 to 2019, cost of solar and wind energy reduced by 89% and 70% for 
example. it would have been unthinkable for any home owner to switch to green energy considering the steep price tags, but now with
prices tags that are comparable or cheaper to fossil fuel solutions due to the competitive energy market and high demand, costs
for the average home owner are cheaper than ever.

The open source standard "Matter" is making more headwaves in the smart furniture industry, aiming to increase compatability amongst
all smart home devices, making smart furniture more seemless as Matter standarizes connections under one system.
Amazon also is looking into implementing AI to Alexa and other Amazon branded smart devices, optimizing smart furniture for
efficency and conveinience. The upfront premium for smart furnitures continue to go down as the market develops and matures over time,
meaning that now is the best time to choose green furniture to save the environment and save more green in your wallet for the long term.
https://www.cnet.com/home/energy-and-utilities/solar-cheat-sheet-your-complete-guide-to-getting-solar-panels-at-home/ (all things solar panels)
^didnt finish this yet but apparently there are community solar panels which dont require some homeowners to personally instal panels to use
solar energy, and this provides helpful info on the costs of solar per watt.
