    <p class="mini-section-title">Amongst other technologies, the cost of solar electricity fell down <em>89%</em> and the cost of wind electricity
    fell down <em>79%</em> from 2009 to 2019. As fossil fuel costs begin to stagnate and renewables grow ever cheaper, green energy
    is an accessible—and affordable—solution for all homeowners.</p>

          <h1>Solar Power</h1>
         
          <p>You can use the sun to generate electricity for your home through solar photovoltaic 
            panels that are installed on your roof. These panels take the sun's rays and convert 
            it into electricity that you can use to warm your home and power your devices. With 
          various installment options such as DIY or even community solar, any homeowner in adequately
          lit environments can take advantage of the significant savings solar provides. </p>

          <h1>Hydroelectric Systems</h1>
          
          <p>This renewable energy source uses water flowing downhill to generate electricity.
             There are many large scale hydroelectric power plants in operation but you can 
             also get small scale ones for your home. These can generate enough electricity 
             to power a home on a river that has a one-meter drop.</p>

          <h1>Wind Energy</h1>
          
          <p>Wind turbines are <em>not</em> just for big wind farms. Smaller wind turbines are available for 
            homes, either as a free-standing pole or installed on the building directly. They generate
             electricity by the wind turning the blades, which drives the internal turbine and creates
            power. Along with solar, they are the most effective at abating carbon all while being cost effective. </p>

          <h1>Biomass Systems</h1>
          <p>Biomass heating systems burn organic materials, such as wood pellets, chips, or logs to 
            provide heating and hot water. This is a lower carbon emitting way of heating compared to fossil 
            fuels like coal and oil.</p>

          <p>Solar heating systems use solar panels to heat water, providing a renewable source of 
            hot water and heating for your home. With the power of the sun, you can enjoy year-round 
            comfort while reducing your carbon footprint and energy expenses.</p>

      <p class="solo-p">In today's world, embracing green energy solutions for your home isn't just a trend, it's a necessity. By transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient appliances, homeowners can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.</p>
      <p class="solo-p">Whether it's installing solar panels on your roof, using smart thermostats to regulate energy usage, or simply switching to LED light bulbs, every small step towards green energy makes a difference. Not only does it benefit the environment, but it also saves you money in the long run by reducing energy bills.</p>
